# 🎵 MP3 Tag Reader & Tag Editor using C

A command-line based **MP3 Tag Reader and Tag Editor** application developed in C, designed to read, display, and modify ID3 metadata from MP3 files.
This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in C programming, binary file handling, and structured data processing.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

The MP3 Tag Reader & Tag Editor application enables users to extract and update metadata information such as **title, artist, album, year, and genre** from MP3 files.
It works by parsing ID3 tags directly from MP3 files using low-level file operations.

This project was developed as part of the **C Programming module** in the **Embedded Systems Professional Course at Emertxe Information Technologies**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- To understand the ID3 tag structure in MP3 files
- To apply binary file handling techniques in C
- To read and modify metadata without corrupting MP3 content
- To improve low-level programming and file parsing skills

---

## ✨ Features

- Add new contact details  
- Search contacts by name or phone number  
- Edit existing contact information  
- Delete contacts safely  
- Display all stored contacts  
- Persistent data storage using files  
- Menu-driven and user-friendly interface  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

- **C Programming**
- **Structures**
- **File Handling (fopen, fread, fwrite, fseek)**
- **Pointers and Arrays**
- **Modular Programming**
- **Input Validation**
- **Control Flow Logic**

---

## 🧠 How the Application Works

- Contact details are stored using **structures**  
- Data is written to and read from files to ensure persistence  
- Each operation (add, search, edit, delete) is handled through separate logical modules  
- Input validation is implemented to avoid invalid or duplicate entries  
- The program follows a clean control flow for better readability
